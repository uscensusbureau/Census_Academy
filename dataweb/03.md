# Getting Started with Census Data: Statistics API

This post will outline how the developer, data analyst/scientist or civic hacker can make sense of the DataWeb API and how to use it to get statistics. This is a longer tutorial, but rewarding if you follow it all the way through!

### What You Will Learn

In the previous tutorials, we learned how to find and narrow down Census data for our topic of interest (TOI): Income inequality. We'll now take the table ID and variable names with us to gain access via the first of three Census APIs we will cover in the up-coming tutorials: The Statistics (aka "[DataWeb](https://api.census.gov/data.html)") API.

## Census Developers' Portal

A good place to start your journey as a developer using Census data is [census.gov/developers](https://census.gov/developers).  Here you can:
1. [Register for an API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
2. Find a link to the Census chat room on [gitter](https://gitter.im/uscensusbureau/home)
3. See recent updates
4. Find general information on the gamut of [Census' publicly available APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)

## The American Community Survey (ACS)

From our previous tutorial, we ended up finding a table and variable from the ACS 1-year dataset. More information can be found about this survey and it's products (e.g.: 1-year, 5-year) by going to the [ACS Microsite on Census.gov](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). We won't go over the details of this or any other survey here as this tutorial is focused on *how* to use the data more than *why* is it collected.

Recall from the previous tutorial our table and variable of interest:

| ID | Table, File or Document Title | Dataset | About |
| --- | ---| --- | :---: |
| B19083 | [GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_16_1YR_B19083&prodType=table) | 2016 ACS 1-year estimates | i |

This resulting table gives us a number of valuable metadata we will need going into our query for data via the statistical API:

1. We'll need the ID: `B19083`
2. We'll need the Title: `GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY`
3. We'll need the Dataset: `2016 ACS 1-year estimates`

## The DataWeb "Discovery Tool"

A handy helper provided by DataWeb in digging through their API is the 'discovery tool' located at [https://api.census.gov/data.html](https://api.census.gov/data.html). This tool is itself an API, which can be accessed in three ways:
1. In web browser-friendly html: [https://api.census.gov/data.html](https://api.census.gov/data.html)
2. In JSON: [https://api.census.gov/data.json](https://api.census.gov/data.json)
3. In XML: [https://api.census.gov/data.xml](https://api.census.gov/data.xml)

This discovery tool is essentially a REST API with a hierarchical structure that branches off into individual endpoints where your actual call for data is made. The structure breaks down into a few parameters:

https://api.census.gov/data/ `year` or [`"timeseries"`](https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries.html) / `survey` or `producer` / `product` /

Here's the discovery endpoint for the 2016 ACS 1-year:

[https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1.html](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1.html)

> TIP: you can replace `.html` with `.json` or `.xml` to get the results back in those formats

You can remove parts from the end of the URL to go up the hierarchy to discover related datasets or choose from the options (e.g.: `variables`, `geographies`, `examples`, etc.) to get more familiar with each endpoint. Additional information is available at [https://census.gov/developers](https://census.gov/developers).

### Finding the Specific Endpoint and Variable ID for Our API Call

Let's go through how we would find the dataset (i.e., API endpoint) and variable ID to make an API call:

1. Go to [https://api.census.gov/data/2016.html](https://api.census.gov/data/2016.html), which aligns with the year named in our first target dataset
2. Dig through the available 2016 endpoints until we find the one we're looking for (`acs/acs1`)
> Note: `Detailed Tables` are where the "estimates" in our `2016 ACS 1-year estimates` reside

3. Click the [`examples`](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/examples.html) link to see how calls are made at all the geographic levels available for that endpoint.
4. We want an example to get all the states, which looks like this:
> [https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=B01001_001E,NAME&for=state:*&key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=B01001_001E,NAME&for=state:*)

You might have already noticed that`B01001_001E` has a few more characters than the ID of the variable we're looking for (`B19083`). That's because - in the API - data can't be displayed or returned as a formatted table. Instead, the data are pretabulated and returned as a single cell as a part of a returned list (in .json format) where every row is one of the geographies we requested.

#### Digging Through The Endpoint The Old Fashioned Way (ctrl+f)

Let's now find our specific variable in the [variables portion of the discovery tool in this endpoint](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/variables.html) of interest by doing a ctrl+f for "B19083".
> Warning: There are 10's of thousands of variables in here. Expect long load times.

We find four rows with this ID that might be of interest to us:

| Name | Label | Concept | Required | Attributes | Limit | Predicate Type | Group | Valid Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |
| B19083_001E | Estimate!!Gini Index | GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY | not required | B19083_001M, B19083_001EA | 0 | int | B19083 | N/A |
| B19083_001A | Annotation of Estimate!!Gini Index	 |   | not required |  | 0 | int | B19083 | N/A |
| B19083_001E | Margin of Error!!Gini Index | GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY | not required | B19083_001M | 0 | int | B19083 | N/A |
| B19083_001MA | Annotation of Margin of Error!!Gini Index |   | not required |  | 0 | int | B19083 | N/A |


## Making Our First DataWeb API Call

Now that we're armed with the variables we want, the endpoint we're accessing and the example call for states from the discovery tool, let's construct our first call:

[https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=B19083_001E,NAME&for=state:*&key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=B19083_001E,NAME&for=state:*)

This gives us the estimate for the Gini index for every state in the US, which looks like this:

```
[["B19083_001E","NAME","state"],
["0.4847","Alabama","01"],
["0.4081","Alaska","02"],
["0.4713","Arizona","04"],
["0.4719","Arkansas","05"],
["0.4899","California","06"],
["0.4586","Colorado","08"],
["0.4945","Connecticut","09"],
["0.4522","Delaware","10"],
["0.5420","District of Columbia","11"],
...
```

## Summary

Woohoo! You did it! Congratulations. You just learned how to use the DataWeb discovery tool to find the API endpoint associated with the table you found in American Factfinder (AFF). You dug through the variables in the **2016 ACS 1-year** endpoint (no small task) and constructed your first call.

Are you excited? I hope so! You now have the tools to make other calls and get other data from other data sets you find interesting. If you don't need to display your data in a map, YOU'RE DONE! :)

If you want to learn how to get geographic boundaries for mapping, please continue on to the next tutorial.
