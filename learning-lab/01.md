# Introduction to Census Data for Developers and Analysts

There are a number of ways a data user can pull down and use Census data. We have tools such as the [American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml), [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/search) and [FTP](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-via-ftp.html). We will be covering a number of Census services to allow you to find out what data Census have related to your topic of interest and retrieve those data.

If at any point during these tutorials, you want help or a quick answer, don't hesitate to reach out via email at: [cnmp.developers.list@census.gov](mailto:cnmp.developers.list@census.gov) or chat with us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/uscensusbureau/home).

The services we’ll be covering through the included tutorials are:
- [Data API](https://api.census.gov/data.html) (statistics)
- [TIGER/Line FTP service](ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger) and  [TIGERweb](https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_main.html) (geographic boundaries)

### What You Will Learn

Before we dive into the workings of Census' APIs, we will first go over some basics of **how Census data is organized** to best prepare you to work with them in an informed and efficient manner.

## Census Data Dimensions

There are three dimensions to all Census data, which we need to cover briefly to start:

1.	Time (vintages and time series data)
2.	Space (geographic areas)
3.	Product (data source or survey)

### Time

The makeup of the US changes over time. Data users can leverage Census data to see what that makeup looks like in the most current 'snapshot', historically or longitudinally (over a period of time).
To facilitate these different use-cases, Census publishes data in two temporal forms:

#### 1.	Vintage Data (covered herein)

Vintage is the term the US Census Bureau uses to reference a dataset by a specific year. Some vintages reference a year in which a survey is collected. Others reference a release year which usually is the final year of a multi-year survey (e.g., The American Community Survey covered herein)

#### 2.	Timeseries Data

Time series data are typically released at higher levels of geography (lowest level = county) because of the fact that Census boundaries change over time (more on this later)

### Space

Census data are released to the public as 'aggregated data.' I.e., in order to protect the confidentiality of respondents', the US Census Bureau tabulates its data into geographic areas rather than publishing exact (point) locations. The exception to this rule is upon the "72-Year Rule," when - 72 years after a survey is conducted - the National Archives releases Census' records (at the record level) to the public. You can find out more about these records at the [National Archives website](https://www.archives.gov/research/census).

Since Census data always refers to a specific geography, All vintaged statistics must be matched with their corresponding vintage of geography (e.g., 2010 Data refers to 2010 Geographies). For new Census data users, this is typically a source of confusion.

New users may be familiar with other popular data providers (e.g., Twitter, Google Maps, etc.) who publish data along with a latitude & longitude coordinate and thus may expect something similar from the Census. However, in order to protect respondent confidentiality, Census publishes the lion’s share of its data within areas (i.e., a shape composed of a payload of bounding coordinates) and does so through different services (there are seperate services for getting statistics and statistics, but none that provide them in the same package). We will cover three services in these tutorials which will allow you to get both statistics and boundaries.

#### Spatial Hierarchy
Census areas have a hierarchical structure wherein some areas nest within others. This will be more important to you as you seek to get lower-level areas' data. To do so, you must specify a higher level as a frame of reference. Here is a handy diagram, which breaks it down succinctly:

*Download a detailed diagram  [here](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf)*

See the hierarchy as a tree list [here](./assets/census-hierarchy.md)

Here is an example of what this nested relationship looks like 'on the ground':

All Census geographies are composed of “Census Blocks,” which are the smallest areas the Census releases data for. Depending on the sample size of the data, these blocks are grouped into larger and larger geographic areas (e.g., counties, states) which make up the US and its territories.

### Product

Though most users of Census data are familiar with the once-a-decade “Census” survey (its namesake), aka “The Decennial Census”, the US Census Bureau conducts many other surveys every year and produces more than one hundred large data products both for its own products as well as for other government agencies. Census surveys and derivative products cover a broad spectrum of subjects including, but not limited to:

1.	Individuals, Families (demographics, covered herein)
2.	Housing and Group Quarters
3.	Businesses and Nonemployers (e.g., owner operators)
4.	Employees and Employers
5.	Industries and Economic Indicators
6.	Governments
7.	Schools (Elementary, Secondary, etc.)
8.	International Trade (imports and exports)

A frequently encountered challenge by developers just beginning to use census data is sifting through this vast universe of measures and concepts. Due to the variance, quality, and quantity of data aggregated, analysis and representation of census data can be an overwhelming experience. It is the intention of this guide to give the user a linear way to identify data of interest and then get that data in a format they can use.

## Summary

Now that we have a broad understanding of the scope of data Census covers and how that data is organized, let's continue in another tutorial on leveraging some of Census' search tools to find what data we'll be accessing via APIs.
