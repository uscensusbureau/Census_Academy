# Searching for Census Variables of Interest

Before we can really do anything of interest with Census data, we should start with a topic of interest. Once you have a topic of interest, it's a matter of narrowing down Census' available data products to those which suit your needs in terms of geographic resolution (e.g.: National-level stats, Counties, Tracts, etc.) and time frame.

### What You Will Learn

In this tutorial, we will be covering how to focus in on the Census data products and - more specifically - variables (the identifiers of statistical characteristics available via API) which might be most useful in providing insight into our topic of interest (TOI).

We'll be using [American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) (AFF) for this purpose. In the future we will be creating a tutorial on how to use the up-coming [data.census.gov search application](data.census.gov), which is a planned replacement for AFF.


## Our Tutorial Touchstone

To help us illustrate a realistic users’ journey, we are going to need an example TOI. For this purpose, the author has chosen one that comes up frequently in recent (at the time of writing) news: **Income Inequality.**

> The Census Bureau has a microsite dedicated to this topic. For more information check out [https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality.html](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality.html)

Let's say we'd like to see different states measure in terms of income inequality over time. So, in this case we now have a rough sketch of what kind of data we're looking for over the three dimensions covered in the first tutorial:

1. Time: We want to show change over time (either a time series or a vintaged product that contains the same measure over multiple vintages)
2. Space: We want a product that gives us statistics at the *state* level
3. Product: We want a product that covers the topic of income - more specifically - for individuals and households

## Getting started with American Factfinder

Let's begin by going over to [American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) and clicking "Advanced Search" and from the drop down "[show me all](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t)".


[IMAGE LOCATED IN DRIVE](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HKNIfPqnloue3IUIUr_dtnJPV8etaECL)

From here we'll just type "income inequality" into the "topic or table name" search field. As we do, we will actually see some instant search results in the type-ahead dropdown below:

`B19083: GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY`

We'll click this type-ahead option to select that search term, then click "GO." We should now see a table that looks something like this:

| ID | Table, File or Document Title | Dataset | About |
| --- | ---| --- | :---: |
| B19083 | [GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_16_1YR_B19083&prodType=table) | 2016 ACS 1-year estimates | i |
| B19083 | [GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_B19083&prodType=table) | 2015 ACS 5-year estimates | i |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

At this point, we have a long list of potential candidates, but this may be shorter or longer than the results you may get for a different query. Let's narrow try to narrow this list down by choosing our **"Geographies"** by clicking the accordingly named sky blue button on the left of the page:

[IMAGE LOCATED IN DRIVE](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HKNIfPqnloue3IUIUr_dtnJPV8etaECL)

This will bring up a dialog box from wherein you will select `State - 040` in this case. You'll then select `All States within the United States and Puerto Rico`, which will add this selection to **"Your Selections"** filters. Now, close the dialog box to view your shortlist. Notice that - in this case the list has not been reduced in size. This is because all of the Tables listed contain data that are available at the *state* level. Groovy. Let's continue.

## Choosing Our Dataset

Now that we have a short list of candidates, let's just choose the one at the top of the list:

| ID | Table, File or Document Title | Dataset | About |
| --- | ---| --- | :---: |
| B19083 | [GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_16_1YR_B19083&prodType=table) | 2016 ACS 1-year estimates | i |

This looks relevant enough. You may be wondering what the difference between the ACS 1-year and the ACS 5-year are at this point, but - don't worry - we'll cover this in more depth in the next tutorial. For now, let's just say that we've found something that looks promising as a source and we'll hope for the best (spoiler: it all works out in the end) as we continue. 

When we click [GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_16_1YR_B19083&prodType=table), we're directed to a new table view that should show the Gini Index for all the states in the US. We can also see on the left side of the results that these are available for every year back to 2006. So, it satisfies our need to show change over time.

#### The Difference Between 1-year and 5-year ACS Products and Things to Consider

It's important to note a couple key differences between the 1 and 5-year ACS products:
1. The 1-year ACS can be compared - year over year - with prior 1-year vintages (i.e., you can show changes year by year by charting the data of each adjacent vintage). However you cannot do this with the 5-year product. With the 5-year product (or any other multi-year ACS product) you must choose non overlapping vintages (e.g., 2011 and 2016, which cover 2007 - 2011 and 2012 - 2016 respectively). More info on that [at the ACS website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data.html).
2. The 1-year ACS is released at a lower geographic resolution (i.e., higher geographic level) than the 5-year product. As the five year is a collection of 1% population samples over 5 years, it contains stats released at the Census Block group, where the 1-year only goes down to the County level.

Also, comparing lower-level Census geographies (e.g., Tracts or Block-groups) can be challenging given that [such boundaries change over time](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data/2014/5-year-comparison.html). There are other nuances which we will not cover in depth in these tutorials, but you are highly encouraged to reach out using the contact info below with any questions you might have. It's better to ask something you might feel is a naive question (which we totally appreciate) than spend a lot of time working on a project just to find out you're doing it wrong. Don't be this guy:

### Downloading the Data Directly

At this point, we could just download the data directly from AFF, which - if you're not a developer - might be the way to go. If this will suffice for you, click the **"Download"** button located above the table view results.

### Getting the Information We Need to Make an API Request

If we'd like to make this call programatically, say for including this and/or other variables within a web/mobile application, we'll need to jot down some of this information for our work, which is continued in the following tutorials.

## Summary

We've used American Factfinder (AFF) to find a table `B19083` and variable name `GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY` for our topic of interest (TOI) and at the geographic level we need: *states*. If we just needed to download this data, we have learned to do that and can call it a day.

If we need to learn how to access this data programatically (via API), we carry on in the next tutorial with these - now more refined - parts of the puzzle:

1. Time: We ~~want to show change over time (either a time series or~~ *found* a vintaged product that contains the same measure over multiple vintages
2. Space: We ~~want~~ *found a product that gives us statistics at the *state* level
3. Product: We ~~want a product that covers the topic of income - more specifically - for individuals and households~~ found out that Census actually includes the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) as a part of their American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year and 5-year products. How convenient for us ;)
